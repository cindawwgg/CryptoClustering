# CryptoClustering

- The data is prepared and normalized using the standardscaler() module from scikit-learn
- The elbow method is applied to find the best k value with a for loop and inertia
- The data is modeled and fitted using Kmeans
- The data is simplified using PCA to reduce the amount of features in the data set
- The data is plotted in a scatter gram format to showcase the clusters of the data
